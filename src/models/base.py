"""The model contract the PDAP trainer depends on.

A model is a *parametrization*, nothing more: it owns the value/gradient
prediction, the atom support, and -- because the outer solve is linear in the
outer parameters ``theta`` -- the feature maps (Jacobians), the ``theta``
packing, and the penalty masks. It owns no training algorithm: the warm start
(:mod:`src.PDAP.warmstart`), the SSN solve (:mod:`src.PDAP.ssn_solve`), and the
evaluation (:mod:`src.eval`) live in the trainer.

``SignedModel`` satisfies this structurally, so it is a
:class:`typing.Protocol` (no inheritance required). ``@runtime_checkable`` lets
tests assert conformance with ``isinstance``.
