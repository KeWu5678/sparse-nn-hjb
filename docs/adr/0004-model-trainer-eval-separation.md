# Models are parametrizations; PDAP is the trainer; evaluation is pure functions

## Context

`src/models/signed.py` and `src/models/semiconcave.py` had each grown to carry
five concerns at once: the network parametrization (forward, weights), the SSN
optimization (both models `from ..SSN import SSN`), the warm-start coordinate
descent, the loss + nonconvex regularizer, and the relative-error evaluation.
The two models duplicated the warm-start (~75 vs ~54 lines, differing only in a
sign convention and a nonnegativity clamp) and the relative-error computation
(identical arithmetic), and they each embedded an SSN solve.

Reading the two SSN solves side by side shows the models are the *same kind of
object*. Both are **linear in their outer parameters θ** for the outer solve:
the data Hessian is `(w1/Nx)·Φvᵀ Φv + (w2/Nx)·Φgᵀ Φg` in both cases — the signed
model's `Φv` is its network matrix and `Φg` its gradient kernel; the semiconcave
model appends structural columns for the curvature `C` and affine `a, b0`. The
differences reduce to (1) which feature columns exist, (2) the penalized/nonneg
masks, (3) sign convention — and (3) is just the nonneg mask. The duplication
existed because nobody factored out "the linear-in-θ SSN problem."

`V = ½C‖x‖² − g(x)` for the semiconcave model is a composition of submodules
(quadratic head + shallow network + affine), each linear in its own parameters,
so it needs no bespoke analytic feature code: predictions and the constant
Jacobians `(Φv, Φg)` can come from autodiffing `forward`. SSN is retained for
*both* models — it is the prox-Newton solver for the nonconvex sparse
regularizer that defines this project; a smooth optimizer (Adam/SGD) cannot
deliver the sparsity or handle the nonsmooth penalty, and the signed model needs
SSN for the identical reason.

## Decision

Separate the three concerns along these layers:

- **`src/models/`** — parametrizations only: `forward` / predictions, named
  parameters, and a tag for which parameters are penalized / nonnegative. No
  import of `..SSN`. The semiconcave model becomes a composed network; its
  Jacobians come from autodiff (constant per support, recomputed only when the
  support changes at insertion), retiring the hand-built feature maps.
- **`src/PDAP/`** — the trainer and the loop-in-loop
  (`insert → warm-start → SSN → prune → insert`). One generic SSN outer solve and
  one generic warm-start, driven by the model's Jacobians and masks.
- **`src/eval.py`** — performance evaluation as pure functions of
  `(prediction, target)` tensors: relative L2/gradient/H1 errors and the
  value/gradient data-loss split. No model state. The nonconvex penalty is *not*
  here — it depends on which parameters a model penalizes, so it stays the
  model's responsibility and is added to the data loss to form the objective.
- **`src/data.py`** — value-sample loading, normalization, and the train/valid
  split (`split_value_samples`), surfaced as `DataConfig.train_fraction`.

This revises ADR-0003's note that "model-level relative errors may remain in the
model/PDAP training path until there is a concrete extraction need": that need
has arrived (verbatim duplication across two models). Evaluation moves to a
dedicated `src/eval.py` rather than into `src/metric.py`, which ADR-0003 reserves
as a reporting/table utility — `metric.py` remains a presentation layer and does
not own performance evaluation.

## Consequences

The change lands as small, golden-backed steps (`tests/test_pdap_equivalence.py`
pins exact summaries), regenerating the golden only when a step deliberately
changes numerics:

1. Extract evaluation to `src/eval.py`; models and PDAP call it; delete the
   duplicated `_compute_relative_errors`. Behavior-preserving (golden unchanged).
2. Delete the dead non-SSN path in `signed.py` (`train`, the generic-optimizer
   branch, SGD fallback, `optimizer_type`); PDAP always uses SSN.
3. Move warm-start into `src/PDAP/` as one generic function.
4. Move the SSN outer solve into `src/PDAP/`, driven by model Jacobians.
5. Rewrite the semiconcave model as a composed network with autodiff Jacobians.
6. Define the thin model contract (`src/models/base.py:PDAPModel`); `SignedModel`
   becomes an adapter over `ShallowNetwork`.

All six steps are implemented. In the event, only step 1's split changed
numerics (a real train/validation split, golden regenerated once); steps 2-6 all
landed bit-exact, including the semiconcave autodiff Jacobians (autograd runs the
same operations the analytic feature maps did). The result: the duplication is
gone, the layering inversion is fixed (neither model imports the SSN optimizer),
evaluation has a single home, and the trainer depends on one explicit model
contract.

## Follow-up: models as nn.Modules; objective/solver config out of the model

Pushing the same principle (model = parametrization, use the framework) further,
three more steps, all bit-exact:

7. **Both models are `nn.Module`s.** `SignedModel` *subclasses* `ShallowNetwork`
   (it is the shallow net, not a wrapper around `self.net`); `SemiconcaveModel`
   is an `nn.Module` with `c, C, a, b0` as parameters registered in θ-order and
   `W, b` as buffers. `theta` (the SSN working vector) is just the trainable
   parameters, read/written with torch's `parameters_to_vector` /
   `vector_to_parameters` — so `get_theta` / `set_theta` leave the contract.
8. **The objective leaves the model.** `compute_loss` is removed; the trainer
   computes the objective (`PDAP._record_loss` for the data term via
   `src.eval.data_loss_terms`, plus `src.PDAP.ssn_solve.nonconvex_penalty` for the
   regularizer — the same penalty the SSN closure uses, so it exists once).
9. **Objective and solver hyperparameters leave the model.** `alpha, gamma, th,
   loss_weights` and `lr, method, max_ls_iter, tolerance_*, sigmamax` move into
   trainer dataclasses (`Objective`, `SolverConfig` in `ssn_solve`), built by PDAP
   from config and threaded to the solve / warm-start / recording. Model
   constructors take only forward-defining parameters (`activation`, `power`,
   plus `c_init`/`dtype` for semiconcave); `power` stays because it defines
   `σ^p` and induces `q = 2/(power+1)`.

The `PDAPModel` contract is now minimal: `power, q, input_dim, last_fit_summary`,
`parameters()`, and the methods `set_atoms / get_atoms / predict / predict_tensors
/ jacobians / penalty_masks`. `jacobians` and `penalty_masks` are the only
model-specific surface the trainer can't obtain from `nn.Module` built-ins —
`jacobians` is the feature-map computation, `penalty_masks` the irreducible
penalty/nonneg structure (the nonneg part *is* semiconcavity, so it cannot be
flattened away). Bit-exactness held because building `nn.Parameter`s consumes no
RNG (unlike `nn.Linear`, whose draw `set_atoms` reuses via `ShallowNetwork`'s
constructor) and `parameters()` yields θ in the same `[c | C | a | b0]` order the
old hand-packing used.

## Penalty selection stays config-driven

The penalty is `alpha * Σ phi(|c|^q)` with two independent knobs — the power-q
exponent (`q = 2/(power+1)`) and the log-nonconvex `phi` (`gamma`, `th`). We
considered a named `penalty: l1 | power_q | log | composed` selector (which would
have decoupled the penalty exponent from the activation power so `log`/`l1` force
`q = 1`), but rejected it: it adds an enum plus validation and a second notion of
`q` for a choice the existing parameters already express. Instead the two
penalties this project uses are selected by parameter values, documented inline in
`ModelConfig`:

- **power penalty** `alpha * Σ |c|^q` — `gamma = 0` (phi is the identity),
  `power > 1` (so `q < 1` is non-convex).
- **log penalty** `alpha * Σ phi(|c|)` — `power = 1` (so `q = 1`), `gamma > 0`.

So the penalty is configurable but not a named axis; `power` and `gamma` remain
its controls, and the penalty exponent stays coupled to the activation power.

## Model compatibility and numerical precision

`PDAP.fit` checks that the supplied model uses the configured activation
callable and power before reading data or changing model state. Callers use
`build_model` with the same configuration as the trainer. This prevents the
trainer's geometry, growth data, and normalized objective from disagreeing with
the actual network. `PDAPModel` also declares activation and state save/restore,
which insertion, history, and the correction guard already require.

Floating-point data, model layers, and numerical work arrays use float64.
Layers are created in float64 before assigning supplied coefficients, so
support replacement cannot round an SSN solution through float32. This changes
the layer-initialization random stream and supersedes the historical bit-exact
behavior above; the PDAP reference summaries are refreshed for this deliberate
numerical change.
