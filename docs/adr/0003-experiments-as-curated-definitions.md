# Experiments are curated definitions, not raw output folders

Curated experiment definitions will live under `experiments/<experiment_name>/`
instead of expanding the legacy `autoresearch/` tree. Each experiment directory
owns the research question, canonical command, analysis script, promoted final
figures, and Markdown summaries. Executable experiment config lives in
`conf/experiment/<experiment_name>.yaml` so Hydra composition remains centralized.
Raw datasets, logs, run records, Hydra output, and intermediate plots stay under
`rawdata/`. Dataset paths resolve through `src.data.DATA_DIR`, independently of
the working directory; Hydra configuration owns the run-output paths.

Top-level `scripts/` is reserved for generic reusable entry points.
Domain-specific runners may remain in `scripts/` while they are legacy and
unclassified, but curated experiments should not add a second training
interface. The root `Makefile` owns the public command and Hydra multirun sweep
axes. Each experiment directory owns the research question, analysis, figures,
and Markdown results, while `scripts/train.py` owns one Hydra-composed PDAP
training config point.

The public Make surface is deliberately small: `help`, `openloop`, and `sweep`.
An earlier 381-line Makefile also encoded paper regeneration, study-specific
analysis, follow-up grids, infrastructure, and repeated Hydra launch policy. Once
the active experiment configurations were collapsed onto shared model and data
axes, those targets no longer represented independent public workflows. We
removed them instead of splitting them into Make includes or introducing a
workflow dispatcher and another YAML schema. Add an orchestration layer only
when a second stable, repeated workflow cannot be expressed as an experiment
configuration passed to `sweep`.

The generic runner boundary is deliberately narrow: run one independent PDAP
training config point on one dataset, compose the configured PDAP model, train
it, write a Run Record, and save only minimal generic artifacts such as a config
snapshot, final metrics, and the full fit result needed for drill-down analysis.
Following ADR-0002, the full fit result is a Run Artifact referenced by the Run
Record, not embedded in the Run Record JSON.
All experiment data loading is centralized around the shared `(x, V(x), dV(x))`
value-sample contract; experiments select datasets rather than defining custom
loaders. The loader accepts the legacy object-backed `.npy` datasets with
`allow_pickle=True`; these are trusted local project artifacts, not an
untrusted-input boundary. New value-sample generators write plain `.npz` arrays.
Generic PDAP training normalizes value samples by default as pre-training data
preprocessing, not as optimizer behavior. The value-sample loader and reversible
normalization transform should live in `src/data.py`, and the fitted transform
is recorded in the Run Record's `normalization` field as `x_scale` and `v_scale`
(`null` when disabled); disabling normalization is a
diagnostic or legacy-reproduction choice, not the default experiment path.
Performance-evaluation functions that become reusable should live in `src`, but
the current model-level relative errors may remain in the model/PDAP training
path until there is a concrete extraction need. Experiments select,
parameterize, aggregate, and present metrics; table helpers such as
`src/metric.py` remain reporting utilities, not the owner of performance
evaluation. Plot function implementations are centralized in `src/plots.py`;
experiments may call those functions but should not own local plotting logic.
Normalization, multi-dataset comparisons, plot invocation, report generation,
and search policy beyond Hydra multirun stay outside the generic runner until
repeated needs justify promotion.

Curated notebooks are limited to three roles: `ssn_optimizer.ipynb` for the SSN
optimizer interface, `pdap_model_configuration.ipynb` for configuring runnable
PDAP models, and `experiment_results_<name>.ipynb` for selected result views
that read Run Records and artifacts. Legacy notebooks are not the source of
truth for sweeps or experiments; they should either be retired or migrated into
an experiment directory after classification.

Final result presentation is Markdown-first: each curated experiment should
publish its stable read in `results.md` or `README.md` with promoted final
figures, while notebooks remain optional interactive views over the same Run
Records and artifacts.

The legacy VDP notebooks classify into separate experiments: `pdpa_vdp.ipynb`
belongs to `log_penalty`, while `pdpa_v3_vdp.ipynb` belongs to
`frac_exp_penalty`. `experiment_analysis.ipynb` is still unclassified.

We chose this over making notebooks the experiment source of truth, over
continuing to grow `autoresearch/`, and over putting every runner in top-level
`scripts/`. The trade-off is a later migration step for legacy outputs and
runners, but the benefit is a clear separation between curated research
definitions, reusable execution machinery, and disposable local artifacts.

The current `scripts/train.py` name is provisional: its role is narrower than
generic "training" and should be reconsidered after the Makefile/Hydra
experiment workflow is proven. It may be renamed to a one-off PDAP config
runner if that vocabulary becomes clearer.
