# Discontinuous-Gradient Activation Search - Summary

This folder repeats the activation search on the analytic Experiment 3 dataset
from `notebook/pdpa_vdp.ipynb`, where the value function is continuous but its
gradient jumps across

```text
h(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 * abs(x2) / 2 = 0.
```

The primary local metric is `near_grad`: relative gradient error on evaluation
points near the discontinuity. The notebook also uses
`near_grad / far_grad` as a localization diagnostic. The masks match the
notebook: near means distance to the switching curve below the 20th percentile,
and far means distance above the 50th percentile.

The detailed variant-level table is `results_near.tsv`. The summary below is
consolidated by activation family: each family is represented by its best
tested variant under `near_grad`.

## Family Leaders

## Main Finding

After consolidation, the same conclusion remains: the best family for behavior
at the discontinuous gradient is **spherical leaky squared ReLU**,

```text
phi_alpha(x) = max(x, alpha*x)^2,
```

with the best tested value `alpha=0.02`.

The improvement is not just from using any kinked quadratic. The antisymmetric
quadratic `x|x|` is worse (`near_grad=0.164566`), and the same leaky squared
ReLU without spherical parameterization is much worse
(`near_grad=0.228469` for `alpha=0.05`).

## Variant Sweep

The leaky ReLU2 sphere family was tested over several leak values. The leading
region is narrow:

| variant | near grad | neurons | near score |
|:--------|----------:|--------:|-----------:|
| `alpha=0.02` | 0.151223 | 120.10 | 18.1617 |
| `alpha=0.025` | 0.151872 | 120.90 | 18.3463 |
| `alpha=0.05` | 0.152113 | 120.20 | 18.2869 |
| `alpha=0.075` | 0.154104 | 110.40 | 17.0111 |
| `alpha=0.10` | 0.155808 | 110.10 | 17.1509 |
| `alpha=0.01` | 0.156104 | 115.20 | 17.9812 |
| ReLU2, no leak | 0.157911 | 106.50 | 16.8143 |

So `alpha=0.02` is best for discontinuity accuracy, but `alpha=0.075` and
plain ReLU2 are stronger sparsity-aware choices.

## Near/Far Ratio

The near/far ratio is diagnostic, not an objective by itself. It measures where
the remaining gradient error lives. A high ratio can mean either:

- the activation fits smooth regions very well, so `far_grad` is tiny;
- or the activation fails badly near the discontinuity.

For the best squared-ReLU families, the high ratio is mostly the first case:
far-field errors are very small, and the remaining error is localized at the
jump. For example, `Leaky ReLU2 sphere (alpha=0.02)` has
`near_grad=0.151223`, `far_grad=0.017083`, and `near/far=8.8520`.

This differs from the notebook's Gaussian example, where the ratio was also
high but the near error stayed poor. In the expanded search, squared ReLU
variants reduce both near and far errors compared with Matérn and Gaussian.

## What Is Specific To The Discontinuity

The previous sections rank by absolute `near_grad`, but that alone does not
prove a discontinuity-specific mechanism. A lower near error can simply come
from a uniformly better approximation everywhere. To separate the two effects,
read `near_grad` together with `far_grad` and `near/far`.

| activation | near grad | far grad | near/far | interpretation |
|:-----------|----------:|---------:|---------:|:---------------|
| Leaky ReLU2 sphere, `alpha=0.02` | 0.151223 | 0.017083 | 8.8520 | best absolute near error; much of the gain is also global because far error is extremely small |
| ReLU2 sphere | 0.157911 | 0.017340 | 9.1068 | same pattern: excellent far fit plus strong near fit |
| x\|x\| sphere | 0.164566 | 0.021366 | 7.7024 | close to ReLU2, but worse in both near and far regions |
| SmoothReLU, `w=0.05` | 0.168244 | 0.055722 | 3.0193 | more discontinuity-specific: near error stays competitive even though far fit is much worse |
| abs activation | 0.177244 | 0.054753 | 3.2371 | kinked value basis helps the jump region, but global fit is weaker |
| ReLU | 0.182863 | 0.057389 | 3.1864 | hard kink gives relatively good near behavior for its far error |
| Gaussian | 0.248449 | 0.031426 | 7.9060 | good smooth-region fit does not transfer to the discontinuity |

The discontinuity-specific factor is therefore **one-sided/kinked gradient
structure**, not just lower H1 error. The target has a gradient jump across

```text
h(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 * abs(x2) / 2 = 0.
```

Activations with a one-sided derivative or a kinked transition can create a
directional contrast across inserted hyperplanes, so their near-region error is
not as bad as their far-region error would suggest. This is why `SmoothReLU`,
`abs`, and `ReLU` have much lower near/far ratios than Gaussian or Matérn.

The leading spherical ReLU2/leaky-ReLU2 family combines two effects:

1. It has enough one-sided polynomial structure to keep the near-gradient error
   low.
2. It fits smooth regions extremely well, which drives `far_grad` down and
   improves the absolute H1/near-gradient numbers.

So the headline should be read carefully: **Leaky ReLU2 sphere is best in
absolute near-discontinuity error, but the clearest discontinuity-specific
signature appears in kinked/one-sided activations whose near error remains
competitive despite a weaker far-region fit.**

## Sparsity Tradeoff

The best-accuracy family uses about 120 neurons. If sparsity matters, the
choice changes:

| choice | near grad | neurons | near score | comment |
|:-------|----------:|--------:|-----------:|:--------|
| Leaky ReLU2 sphere, `alpha=0.02` | 0.151223 | 120.10 | 18.1617 | best discontinuity accuracy |
| Leaky ReLU2 sphere, `alpha=0.075` | 0.154104 | 110.40 | 17.0111 | best leaky sparse compromise |
| ReLU2 sphere | 0.157911 | 106.50 | 16.8143 | sparsest good baseline |

The unconstrained `near_score = near_grad * neurons` is not reliable by itself:
very sparse low-rank activations such as `sp2_b0_2` and `qr_0_05` get low
scores only because they use 9-11 neurons, but their near-gradient errors are
around `0.39`, which is poor behavior at the discontinuity.

## When Gamma Matters Most

For this experiment, the main accuracy metric is `near_grad`, and the sparsity
metric is the mean selected neuron count. Gamma has the largest absolute effect
on noncompetitive smooth/saturating activations, not on the leading squared-ReLU
families.

| activation | near-grad range | neuron range | near-score range | largest step | interpretation |
|:-----------|----------------:|-------------:|-----------------:|:-------------|:---------------|
| `asinh` | 0.4484 | 4.2 | 25.30 | `0.01 -> 0.1` | largest absolute effect, but the fit is poor |
| `gelu_b0_2` | 0.0607 | 21.6 | 5.29 | `0 -> 0.01` | gamma strongly changes sparsity and accuracy |
| `smoothy_relu_w0_05` | 0.0440 | 4.2 | 5.66 | `1 -> 10` | gamma matters for near-discontinuity accuracy |
| `mish_b0_15` | 0.0320 | 16.8 | 7.05 | `0 -> 0.01` | strong sparsity/score effect, but not a top near-gradient fit |
| `softplus_b0_25` | 0.0274 | 10.2 | 2.68 | `1 -> 10` | gamma changes sparsity, still not competitive near the jump |
| Leaky ReLU2 sphere, `alpha=0.02` | 0.0051 | 5.5 | 0.64 | `1 -> 10` | best near accuracy is robust to gamma |
| Leaky ReLU2 sphere, `alpha=0.075` | 0.0081 | 3.2 | 1.37 | `1 -> 10` | sparse compromise is also robust |
| ReLU2 sphere | 0.0047 | 4.5 | 0.63 | `0 -> 0.01` | sparsest good baseline is robust |

This is the important distinction: gamma can move some weak activations a lot,
but it does not rescue them into the leading group. Among the useful
near-discontinuity fits, gamma changes the exact sparsity/accuracy point only
slightly; the activation shape, especially spherical squared ReLU with a small
leak, dominates the result.

This also means the VDP-side heuristic "gamma matters most for high-neuron or
sharp/inactive activations" does not generalize here. The generated
`../gamma_pattern_check.md` file lists counterexamples such as `asinh`,
`mish_b0_15`, `atan`, `swish_b0_25`, and `gelu_b0_2`, which have large
gamma-induced score changes without being high-neuron sharp/inactive fits.

## Program (original program.md)

# autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical

Autonomous search for activation functions on the analytic value function with
a discontinuous gradient from `notebook/pdpa_vdp.ipynb` Experiment 3.

## Fixed Study

Use signed-profile PDAP (`model="signed"`, `insertion="profile"`) with:

- `power=1`
- `loss="h1"`
- gamma list `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`
- `alpha=1e-5`
- `num_iterations=10`
- `num_insertion=50`
- `pruning_threshold=1e-5`
- training grid: 30x30 points on `[-2, 2]^2`
- evaluation grid: 61x61 points on `[-2, 2]^2`
- target: `V = x1^2 + x2^2 + abs(x1 + x2*abs(x2)/2)`

The global score is

```text
score = eval_h1 * best_neurons
```

where `eval_h1` is computed analytically on the dense evaluation grid at the
PDPA-selected best iteration for each gamma.

For this Experiment 3 task, the primary result is discontinuity behavior:

```text
near_grad = relative gradient error on points near h(x1, x2)=0
```

Use `rank_discontinuity.py` to reselect the best gamma per seed by smallest
`near_grad`. Use `near_score = near_grad * neurons` only as a sparsity-aware
secondary metric.

## What You Do

```text
LOOP FOREVER:
  0. Ensure the run directory exists:
       mkdir -p autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/runs

  1. Read autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/results.tsv. Pick an
     activation that has not been run yet, or a promising activation that has
     only partial seed coverage.

     Start with:
       tanh, matern52, softplus, gaussian,
       relu, gelu_b0_25, softplus_b0_25, softplus_b0_15,
       smoothy_relu_w0_25, mish_b0_25, mish_b0_15, celu, elu,
       qr_0_1, sp2_b0_25

     You may use any activation already registered in
     scripts/run_activation_experiment.py, because the discontinuous runner
     imports the same ACTIVATIONS registry. For this task, `gaussian` is
     overridden to the Experiment 3 notebook definition `exp(-z^2/2)`.

  2. For each seed in {42, 43, 44, 45, 46}:
       uv run python scripts/run_discontinuous_activation_experiment.py \
         --activation <name> --seed <seed> \
         > autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/runs/<name>_seed<seed>.json 2>&1

     Each call prints one JSON line with per-gamma results, best gamma,
     eval metrics, near/far gradient errors, and elapsed time.
     If `uv` is unavailable, use `.venv/bin/python` with the same script and
     arguments.

  3. Aggregate:
       uv run python autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/scripts/aggregate.py \
         --activation <name> \
         --description "<short note>"

  4. Append one row to:
       autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/results.tsv

     Columns:
       commit, activation, power, loss, seeds, mean_score, std_score,
       mean_eval_h1, mean_eval_grad, mean_neurons, mean_near_grad,
       mean_far_grad, near_far_ratio, best_gamma_mode, status, description

  5. Continue with the next activation.
```

## Constraints

- Do not modify `src/` for this study.
- Keep the algorithm settings above fixed.
- Use `use_sphere=True` only where the shared activation registry already marks
  it as true.
- If a run crashes, inspect the run file. Fix runner-level issues if needed;
  otherwise aggregate the valid seeds as `partial` and move on.

## Plotting

After several rows exist:

```bash
uv run python autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/scripts/plot_pareto.py
uv run python autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/scripts/rank_discontinuity.py
uv run python autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/scripts/plot_near.py
```

This writes `autoresearch/ActivationSearch/data:analytical/pareto.png`,
`results_near.tsv`, and `near_pareto.png`. For this dataset, read
`near_pareto.png` first.
